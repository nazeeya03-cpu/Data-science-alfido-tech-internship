Please tell me one of the following options:

1. ðŸ“‚ You have a dataset file â€” If yes, please upload the Zomato dataset (CSV, Excel, etc.) here.

Iâ€™ll read it, analyze key insights (ratings, cuisines, locations, etc.), and create clear visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, etc.).



2. ðŸ“Š You donâ€™t have a file â€” I can use a sample Zomato dataset and show you how to analyze and visualize it using Python (with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn).
